    <h1>A Year of Garbage Movies - 2019</h1>
    <h2>An adventure through IMDB's Bottom 100 Films</h2>
    <h3>Originally published January 19, 2019</h3>
    <p>Most people see the new year as a chance to commit to improving themselves. Gym memberships soar, Facebook is littered with pledges to assert oneself more, and somewhere in a sterile replica Holiday Inn conference center beneath the Hollywood Hills, Tony Robbins comes out of his yearly hibernation cycle to feed again.</p>
    <p>I decided to do the opposite of all that and pursue something that will only make me a worse person in some way. I’m going to watch all of the unseen movies in the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom">IMDB Bottom 100 list</a>.</p>
    <p>The original plan was to watch all 100, but honestly the thought of having to sit through “Disaster Movie” again and do a write-up afterward is too much. I can only endure the site of a cheap puppet version of Alvin & The Chipmunks chewing on a guys nuts once per lifetime. Therefore I’ll only be watching and doing a Pros and Cons assessment of the ones I haven’t seen yet.</p>
    <p>The list starts with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0806147/?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&pf_rd_p=c28fd853-7526-417a-ad2b-02e76562a472&pf_rd_r=3XC5MFCT6AF9Q1FTDP60&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_t=15506&pf_rd_i=bottom&ref_=chtbtm_tt_100">#100, “Extreme Movie” (2008)</a>. May God have mercy on my soul.</p>
